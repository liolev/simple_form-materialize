# SimpleForm::Materialize

This gem includes a generator for [SimpleForm](https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form) configuration with [MaterializeCSS](https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize). It also includes custom inputs for materialize.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'simple_form_materialize'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

    Or install it yourself as:

        $ gem install simple_form-materialize

## Usage

Run the SimpleForm configuration generator:
``` rails g simple_form:materialize:install ```

The generator will currently create an initializer and add it to your application as well as add a mixin to SimpleForm::Inputs::Base which is used by [Character Count](http://materializecss.com/forms.html#character-counter).
